Hello Guys,

I'm going to talk to you about the project I had written so long ago. 
The first reason to share this mode is the development of the MTA development environment, using all of us.
You can use the mode as you like with open source code.
Also I do not think there is any mistake because the mode is final version.

Run versions [:]
 - Linux ✓
 - Windows ✕ ( Untested )
 
 How to establish?
 
 - After downloading the mods, drop them into the resources / folder.
   ● Make sure all modes are thrown!

 - Drop the modules folder inside the modes into the deathmatch / folder.
   ● Depending on the platform you are installing, the executable files you are going to change may vary.
 
 - When you enter modes and modules files into the MTA configuration file, you can make the server ready.

 ● If your processor is Linux,
   ● module src="mta_mysql.so"
   ● module src="sha.so"
 
 ● If your processor is Windows,
   ● module src="mta_mysql.dll"
   ● module src="sha.dll"
